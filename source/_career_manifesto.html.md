Senior / Staff Software Engineer

- full time direct hire
- not a management role, but an engineering technical leader that can mentor and guide others with architecture, direction, coaching, pairing, and discussions
- I love helping people level up

## desired outcomes

**Primary:** seeking a culture that is supportive of learning, sharing knowledge, skills, product info, and discussions to promote mutual and systemic growth in ability to deliver the product

- Along with this, the company actively reaches out to the employees and communities within which it exists to proactively ensure no harm comes to the most vulnerable and all people can see representation across the business.

- The company is concerned more with quality, sustainability, managed experimentation, with a focus on operationalizing, reliability, scalability, and extensibility, rather than just a feature factory or a total flypaper app.

- This requires the support of management and coworkers to ensure Iâ€™m included in meetings and information exchanged

- a company that already knows what it's business and value proposition are
- digital/remote first, asynchronous
- I love working with Rails, Postgresql, and JavaScript, including several frameworks; no Java or PHP, please
