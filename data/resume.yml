      <br><br>
      During my time as a mentor with GDI, my local chapter in Minneapolis had some horrible incidents of overt racism and denial at the leadership level. I count myself as culpable in this problem as I had no realization it was happening. This set of incidents festered and spread through other chapters, and on to the national headquarters.
      <br><br>
      I ended my relationship with Girl Develop It after it became apparent to me the organization leadership had absolutely no intention to repair the problems with including Women of Color and hearing the problems they spoke up about.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Do not support this group. It is not diverse or inclusive. Worse, it refuses to admit and confront these failings in itself.</strong>
