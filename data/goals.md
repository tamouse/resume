## desired outcomes

**Primary:** seeking a culture that is supportive of learning, sharing knowledge, skills, product info, and discussions to promote mutual and systemic growth in ability to deliver the product

Along with this, the company actively reaches out to the employees and communities within which it exists to proactively ensure no harm comes to the most vulnerable and all people can see representation across the business.

**Secondary:** a company concerned more with quality, sustainability, managed experimentation, with a focus on operationalizing, reliability, scalability, and extensibility, rather than just a feature factory or a total flypaper app.
